Combat begins when one or more characters acts adversarially towards another, and continues while at least one character continues to instigate combat and they don’t have a filled stress clock.

## Turn Order

Turn order is determined by the initiative and readiness of characters in the scenario. This order can be built as the combat progresses.

Some examples:

- A party member is initiating an ambush against a group of enemies. They would be the one to go first, followed by the remaining party members, then the enemies.
- A party member planned out their move going into the battle and knows what to do, so they’ll go first. Whoever comes up with what they want to do will go after. Enemies enter the turn order as they retaliate.
- An enemy gets a jump on the party and surprises them with the initial attack, putting themselves first. The first player to get hit needs to retaliate, thereby putting themselves second.

If the order can’t be decided clearly in this way, roll a die per character to resolve ambiguities. Higher rolls go before lower rolls.

## Actions

A **combat action** is something you do proactively on your turn. Examples of combat actions:

- Punch an enemy
- Hide somewhere
- Heal an ally
- Break a window
- Fire a rocket launcher

If something you want to do doesn’t fit cleanly within the definition of a single action, the GM will have jurisdiction on how to resolve it.

On your turn, you can perform **1 action**.

## Reactions

At any time, you may need to perform an action roll to react to the action of a player, that of an enemy, or some other event, like a bomb going off. This type of roll is a reaction.

After your first reaction, you become distracted. Upon reaching your turn in combat, you are no longer distracted.

## Distractions

It’s hard to focus on everything around you all at once. Various circumstances may cause you to become distracted. Performing a reaction roll is one way to become distracted.

If you are distracted in combat, your rolls have an additional snag die.

## Assistance

In combat, to assist a team member, **you cannot be distracted**. Once you do assist them, you become distracted.

## Example

As you’re sneaking into a museum, you find yourself caught by two security guards.

Since you’ve been on high alert, you go first in combat order. You spend your action aiming to knock the first guard onto the floor. They try to retaliate by dodging, but fail. They fall down and take one stress.

The second guard is still standing, so they’ll go next in turn order. They lunge forward to try to pin you against the wall. You react and you manage to stand your ground. You are now distracted.

The first guard is last in turn order. They try to kick you and make you lose your balance. Even while distracted, you get a critical success on your reaction roll, and you nimbly dodge the kick and escape the grasp of the guard that’s still standing.

Turn order goes back to you. You are no longer distracted.

You decide this fight is too much trouble. You throw down a smoke bomb with your first action, then run with your second action. Time is money.
