1. Give your character a name, and add a reference image if you have one.
2. Choose an [archetype](/archetypes).
3. You start with 8 experience. Distribute these among your available attributes. **No attribute can be greater than level 3.**
4. For your inventory, give your character some starting items, including money and items that they carry with them. There’s no limit to what can be here, or it’ll be up to the GM’s discretion.
5. Resilience, stress, and condition should all stay as they are.
