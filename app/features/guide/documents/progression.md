Progression comes in the form of milestones, a climax or other important event that happens in the story, where the players take a big step towards their goal, make it out alive from a perilous situation, or defeat a powerful and significant enemy, to name a few examples.

The party has a shared **experience** level, starting at 8. Each milestone will increase this experience level by one, giving each player an extra point to spend on their attributes.
