## Learning Recipes

Before you can begin synthesizing, you must possess the recipe and its ingredients in your inventory.

Recipes are documents with steps that describe how a substance is created. They can be found, traded, purchased, and so on. The recipe itself is imbued with the necessary enchantment to synthesize the item. Once you no longer have the recipe, you can no longer create the item.

Ingredients must be gathered from their respective locations, purchased, traded, or found through other means.

## Gathering Ingredients

When entering a new area, make a [Perception](https://www.notion.so/Perception-98ee020d85ee4b41825274715059431a?pvs=21) roll. With more successes, you’ll find rarer ingredients:

- 1 or more: Common
- 3 or more: Uncommon
- 5 or more: Rare
- 7 or more: Very Rare
- 9 or more: Legendary

If there are ingredients found, you may attempt to harvest any of your choice by making a [Nature](https://www.notion.so/Nature-e5d940c425e24d1bb515d52ea0b61eeb?pvs=21) roll.

For every success, roll a d12, then take the highest number of the pool. Collect that many of the ingredient.

On failure, you mishandle the ingredients and render them useless.

## Synthesis

Once you posses the recipe, you may begin the synthesis process, which is often as simple as combining crushed or grinded materials together, then letting them brew in a cask for a while with the recipe nearby.

Make an [Alchemy](https://www.notion.so/Alchemy-3ded32a6b37547ffb1aa64189bb63dad?pvs=21) roll. You gain one unit of the item for each success. In any case, the items are consumed and removed from your inventory.

## Prices

The prices of ingredients are determined by their rarity, and items prices are the combination of their ingredients’ prices.

The prices are not fixed; merchants and traders may ask for a higher or lower prices depending on demand or other situational circumstances.
