Characters have two distinct stress clocks: physical stress, and mental stress.

## Physical Stress

Physical stress represents the damage you take on your body, from cuts, bruises, and other injuries. Physical stress add snag dice to your physical action rolls.

At **six** ticks of physical stress, your character becomes incapacitated. They cannot move or perform any physical actions.

## Mental Stress

Mental stress represents the toll on your head from psychologically-demanding tasks and situations. Mental stress add snag dice to your non-physical rolls.

At six mental stress ticks, your character becomes **insane.** You will automatically fail any non-physical rolls. Depending on the circumstances, they may fall unconscious for a long period of time.

## Healing

Stress is healed by characters taking the appropriate actions in the story. The amount of stress healed depends on the situation.

## Examples

A broken bone would give you multiple ticks of physical stress. A cast or crutch would heal less ticks from that. You’d be able to work around it a bit, but the core source of the stress doesn’t go away. A healing spell to mend the bone would remove all of the stress.

A precarious, mentally-taxing situation might give you multiple ticks of mental stress. Stopping for a moment to calm down and [Resolve](https://www.notion.so/Resolve-6889d44d193443c7ad1b422485efeee4?pvs=21) might help heal some of it, but getting away from the situation would be the best way to heal all of it.
