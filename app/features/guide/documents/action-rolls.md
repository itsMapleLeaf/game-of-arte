To perform various actions in game that may or may not succeed, the DM may ask you to perform an action roll.

An action roll will use a number of d12 dice depending on the level of the related attribute and your character’s archetype:

- Level 1: 1 die
- Level 2: 2 dice
- Level 3: 4 dice
- Level 4: 7 dice
- Level 5: 12 dice

An action succeeds depending on how many successes you get with the roll. A 9, 10, or 11 counts as one success, and a 12 counts as two.

For example, for **Perception** roll at level 3, you would roll 4 dice. If your character is a strategist, you would roll 6 dice.

A success is a success, but the GM may alter the narrative depending on the number of successes. For example, if you attempt to cast a spell, a single success could mean the spell succeeds as expected, and multiple successes could mean it goes much further than intended.

The roll fails if there are no successes. When this happens, you get a **resilience point**.

## Modifier Dice

Modifiers are d4 dice that can be applied to a roll based on the status of your character, the situation, or other factors.

There are two kinds of modifier dice: boost dice, and snag dice. Every 4 on a boost dice adds a success, and every 4 on a snag dice removes a success.

## Resilience

Every session, each player starts with 2 resilience points.

At any time, you can spend _N_ resilience points to get _N_ boost dice on your next roll.

## Assistance

You can also spend resilience points to add boost dice to another player’s roll, but you must describe narratively how you’re helping them.

## Example

You’re travelling to another city, but you forgot your passport, and you’re afraid the border agent might not let you through.

You try to persuade them to let you in. Your persuade level is 1, so you roll 1d12, for a result of 4. The roll fails, and you gain a resilience point. They calmly and plainly deny your entry, calling for the next person to come in.

Without any other options, you try to sneak in another way. With your dexterity level of 3, you decide to spend two resilience points for two extra dice. You roll 6d12, with the results 7, 11, 3, 8, and 12. The 11 gives you one success, and the 12 gives you two, for a total of three successes. You manage to slip into a fairly unguarded part of the city’s border without issue.

You hope this won’t have consequences later, but you don’t plan on staying for very long anyway.
