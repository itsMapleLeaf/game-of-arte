Mana is an arcane presence that naturally exists almost everywhere in Arte, and in the bodies its inhabitants, who rely on it to live. Little is known about the true nature of it, but through research and experimentation, Artesians managed to harness its power to perform feats impossible through other means.

Sorcery is the manipulation of mana to this end. Acts of sorcery will exhaust the available mana in the environment and in your body, depending on the strength of the act. Excessive acts of sorcery will lead to physical and mental weakness. The drawbacks and unexpected side effects keep it from being a commonplace practice outside of specific use cases.

Sorcery is performed through the use of casting devices, which are mana-imbued accessories created for the purpose of casting spells. Any artesian can make use of a casting device.

See the [spellbook](/spellbook) for the list of available spells.

## Casting

<aside>Ensure you have a casting device!</aside>

1. Pick a spell from the spell book, or attempt a freeform spell.
2. Decide if you would like to amplify the spell.
3. Make a roll depending on the spell’s attribute.
4. The DM may apply other modifiers depending on the situation
5. Wait for the spell’s casting time to resolve, if it’s not immediate.
6. If the roll succeeded, resolve the spell’s effect.
7. Apply the cost of the spell.

## Costs

Each spell has an associated cost. For example, if the cost is 1 mana, 1 stress, this means the spell removes **one** tick from the mana supply, and adds **one tick of mental stress** to your character.

## Amplify

When casting a spell, you may choose to amplify it, which strengthens its effect in some way. If you amplify a spell, take one tick of mental stress on top of the spell’s cost.

## Mana Supply

Every location has a limited amount of **excess mana** in the area for sorcery. This is represented by a clock with 12 ticks. Acts of sorcery (successful or otherwise) will remove ticks from this clock.

When the clock is empty, further acts of sorcery will use **essential mana**, which is much more abundant, but is required for Artesians to function.

If the pool of excess mana is empty before applying the cost of a spell, roll one die. If the roll fails, everyone present in the scene will feel physically weaker, and take one tick of physical stress.

## Casting Time

Some spells may take an extended period of focus to resolve. While the spell is being cast, the caster is focused and cannot perform any other action.

“Turns” in a spell’s casting time refers to the number of caster’s turns in a combat encounter. Outside of combat, one turn is ten seconds.

For example:

- If a spell takes one turn to cast, the caster will start casting the spell on the first round.
  On the caster’s second turn, the spell will resolve.
- If a spell takes two turns to cast, the caster will start casting the spell on the first round.
  On the caster’s second turn, they will still be focused and cannot perform any other action.
  On the caster’s third turn, the spell will resolve.

If the caster’s focus is broken, the spell will not resolve, but the costs will still apply. Focus can be broken by various means, such as being startled by a loud noise, being physically assaulted, or otherwise their position of stillness being interrupted. In some situations, you may make an additional Resolve or Endurance roll to keep focus on the spell in response to a potential interruption.

## Concentration

Some spells require concentration in order to keep their effect. You can lose concentration in a few ways:

- becoming distracted
- casting another spell requiring concentration

Concentration doesn’t prevent you from performing combat actions.

## Freeform Sorcery

Throughout history, inventive sorcerers have experimented and refined the practice of mana manipulation and distilled the most well-known and consistent recipes into the spell book. On that token, it’s possible to make up spells of your own!

Describe your intent, and the GM will do their best to assign a fair cost to what you’re attempting to accomplish.

## Arcane Connections

Arcane connections are formed when a sorcerer spends a non-trivial amount of time with someone else. The strength thereof is correlated with the well-being of both parties.

Damaged well-being of one member can cause the other to take stress depending on the nature of the weakness.
